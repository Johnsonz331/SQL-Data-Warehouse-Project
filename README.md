# Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
## Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

## Specifications
- Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
